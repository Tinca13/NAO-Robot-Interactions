# NAO-Robot-Interactions
Scripts that allow for full manipulation of the NAO robot's joints and sensors. Built using Python 2.7 32-bit (requirement for the naoqi module which works with the NAO robot). These scripts are for general purpose use for interacting with the robot. For more advanced experimental methods, the [old-gui branch](https://github.com/EThomas16/NAO-Robot-Interactions/tree/old-gui) contains more advanced functionality.

## Functionality:
- Speech recognition: for use with an external microphone, to allow control of the robot through speech commands with Python's [speech recognition module](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/).
- GUI: Contains sliders to manipulate each joint of the robot's body as well as an option to perform preset movements.
- Live video: Streaming of video from the robot's camera.

## Voice commands:
